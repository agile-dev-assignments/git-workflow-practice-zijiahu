Here are some excerpts from the article, [*Tech’s Ethical ‘Dark Side’: Harvard, Stanford and Others Want to Address It*](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/06/reader-center/ontech-newsletter-writer.html), I found online.

> “Technology is not neutral,” said Professor Sahami, who formerly worked at Google as a senior research scientist. “The choices that get made in building technology then have social ramifications.”

> “We need to at least teach people that there’s a dark side to the idea that you should move fast and break things,” said Laura Norén, a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Data Science at New York University who began teaching a new data science ethics course this semester. “You can patch the software, but you can’t patch a person if you, you know, damage someone’s reputation.”

>“As we start to see things, like autonomous vehicles, that clearly have the ability to save people but also cause harm, I think that people are scrambling to build a system of ethics,” he said.

I found this article interesting because it discussed technology ethics, which is a topic that I think still being overlooked by people. When talking about software development/engineering, people tend to think how to build a good software, but often forget, or ignore, the consequences it might bring people. Sometimes, people will benefit from technology, but there is indeed harm that I think will be brought by technology at the same time. In this article, Joi Ito, director of the M.I.T. Media Lab, says “As we start to see things, like autonomous vehicles, that clearly have the ability to save people but also cause harm, I think that people are scrambling to build a system of ethics.” So, I think when building softwares, there are many factors needed to be considered, and there are indeed compromises we need to make.
